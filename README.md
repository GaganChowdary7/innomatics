> [Embedded JavaScript Templating](https://ejs.co/)  
> [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

**2. Back-End :**

> [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)  
> [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)  
> [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)  
> [Other NPM packages](https://github.com/dfwteinos/Airbnb/blob/main/package.json)  

</br>


## Some words about the subject of the Assigment:

We asked to implement a fully functional Web Application that supports all the functions that implements the Appartment-Based sites, such as:     
</br>
> **[Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.gr/?_set_bev_on_new_domain=1601885105_NDNhZDM1Y2U4MzY0)**   
> **[Booking](https://www.booking.com/index.el.html?label=gen173nr-1BCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaFyIAQGYAQi4ARnIAQzYAQHoAQGIAgGoAgO4Atqn6_sFwAIB0gIkNmU2YjhiYTgtYTRlOC00OGYzLWExMDAtNTVmZGQ4MjU2ZDJh2AIF4AIB;keep_landing=1&sb_price_type=total&)**  
> **[TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com.gr/)**

</br>

## The procedures and the Functions that this specific Web Application can execute among other things, are as follows:

*   Login
*   Logout
*   Edit Profile
*   SignUp
*   Search for Appartment (based on dates and some filters, including the price and some other facilities)
*   Rent an Appartment
*   Upload an Appartment
*   Send Messages
*   Leave Reviews either for Appartment or for the Host
*   Extract user data as .XML or .JSON format
*   And many more..


## Run the app localy using GoormeIDE:

* First of all, you must download the source code as follows: `git clone https://github.com/dfwteinos/Airbnb.git`
* Second, you need to enable MongoDB within your container. If you have a problem, then [click here](https://help.goorm.io/en/goormide/18.faq/language-and-environment/how-to-install-mongodb).
* Then, open a terminal and type `mongod` and then press enter.
* Afterwards, you should type into an another terminal `node app.js` and start running the server.
* Last but not least, you should click on `Project` (on the toolbar) and then running URL and Port. Additionally , check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CYTQm-6t9w)
